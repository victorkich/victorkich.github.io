## About Me

I am an M.Eng. student at the University of Tsukuba, specializing in deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and robotics. Under the supervision of [Prof. Akihisa Ohya](https://www.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~ohya/index_eng.html) and co-supervision of [Prof. Ayano Yorozu](https://www.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~yorozu/index_en.html), my research focuses on developing advanced algorithms for state representation learning and their applications in autonomous systems. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, aiming to contribute to innovative research that advances the capabilities of intelligent agents.
